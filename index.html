          <p class="switch-lede">After slowing in mid-July, the big 2016 rally in credit has resumed in the past two weeks. The US Corporate index
            touched 147bp on August 2, following a brief sell-off, but has rallied to 138bp since then. The US High Yield
            index experienced a similar pause, but the price has now risen to $98.8, the highest level since June 2015. The

            index positions, implementing more efficient directional trades than is possible with an index trade, and we
            discuss how CDS options can be used to implement very specific relative value views between, for example, high
